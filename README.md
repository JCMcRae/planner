## Introduction
This is the custom in-house Instagram content planning and publishing tool for CYSTech + CYS Special Projects.

### Getting Started
Since we do not have our CYSTech Single Control Tool built yet, we can simply run this program as such, from the `PLNR` directory:

```python3 com.cystech.plnr/app/main.py```

This requires the bot-env library.
